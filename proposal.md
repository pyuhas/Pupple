# Project Description

####  I am passionate, or should I say pawssionate, about the bond between a dog and its human. That type of unique, unconditional love is something to experience.
####  [App name] will be a simple, easy to use app to find potential pets with the right fit for any person. Just like a match-making service, find the most compatible fit for you both!



# Problem statement

####   There are so many dogs that need homes. Why not invite them into yours? Wouldn't you rather live in a home rather than a kennel? Of course! Studies have shown that a person can live longer and have a better quality of life by having a fur-ever friend.

# How will your project solve this problem?

####  [App name] will ask the user about their lifestyle, activity level, home/living situation, interests, etc. to match them with the best canine companion.

# Map the user experience

####  Bruce is an avid hiker and camper. He grew up without any experience to pets. He was always a little unsure about them and didn't know if a dog would be too much work for his lifestyle. Bruce looked on [App name] one day while he was waiting in the dentist's office and was matched with a two year old black lab. He couldn't get the picture of the lab out of his head so he decided to go for it and adopt her! She became his new best friend, who just so happens to also love hiking and camping. Who would've thought?!

#### Batinka always assumed she was a cat person. She works a lot and has time for no one but herself...or so she thought. A coworker had her go on [App name] where she was matched with a small, fluffy puppy who has just as much sass as she does! She ended up adopting her and they even sometimes wear matching outfits! According to Batinka's coworkers, she has been more pleasant to work with!

#### Roger raised two children who are both now adults and have moved away. He is retired, lives alone, enjoys gardening, and going on long walks. Roger's children were home for the holidays and went onto [App name] with him. He ended up matching with an calm, older dog that they all decided he should adopt. The dog became the perfect companion to join Roger on his long walks and always lays next to him in the sun while he gardens.


# What technologies do you plan to use?

#### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, Express, Node.js, Knex, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Cypress, Petfinder API?, and then a web scraper for my new technology (Any suggestions??)
